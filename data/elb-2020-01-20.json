Who should draw electoral maps&#x2014;and how? How can we best protect voting rights? How should the census be administered? How do we preserve the regulatory process&#x2019;s democratic legitimacy? And, are members of Congress entitled to see the President&#x2019;s tax returns? These papers are forthcoming in the&#xA0;<em>George Mason Law Review</em>. In addition, the event featured a Keynote Conversation&#xA0;with two former public servants with deep expertise in both governance and campaigns:&#xA0;Robert Bauer, former White House Counsel to President Obama, and Donald McGahn, former White House Counsel to President Trump.</p><p>The first panel focused on the administration of federal campaign finance laws. We discussed two new papers: Capital University Law School Professor Bradley Smith&#x2019;s paper, &#x201C;Feckless: A Critique of Criticism of the Federal Election Commission Structure, and Possible Lessons for the Administration of Campaign Finance and Election Law,&#x201D; and George Washington University Law Professor Richard Pierce&#x2019;s paper, &#x201C;A Realistic Version of Campaign Finance Reform and Two Essential Steps Toward a Return to Effective Governance.&#x201D; Pierce is affiliated with the Gray Center as a member of our Advisory Council. The discussion was moderated by the Gray Center&#x2019;s Executive Director, Adam White, and also features a welcome from&#xA0;<em>George Mason Law Review</em>&#xA0;Editor-In-Chief, Conor Woodfin.

He took one of them, Roman Nasirov, at the time the head of Ukraine&#x2019;s tax service, to Mr. Trump&#x2019;s Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where they chatted with the president-elect in a crowd of supporters, a video released by Mr. Parnas&#x2019;s attorney shows. Mr. Nasirov ultimately helped fund a $10 million loan Mr. Parnas arranged for the project, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>A sizable donation to a political campaign typically brings a handshake and some chitchat with the candidate. In the three years that followed, Mr. Parnas went further.</p><p>As he launched himself into Mr. Trump&#x2019;s orbit, Mr. Parnas found sponsors for his own ventures among wealthy Republican donors, mingling with them at fundraisers and dinners that he documented in copious selfies. He also sought out and eventually became a key associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president&#x2019;s personal attorney, who embraced Mr. Parnas in his pursuit of investigations in Ukraine.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The role he has carved out for himself has thrust the Ukrainian-born Mr. Parnas into the impeachment saga, injecting a wild card into the tightly choreographed&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-outline-plan-for-removing-trump-11579392444?mod=article_inline\">proceedings on Capitol Hill</a>.
