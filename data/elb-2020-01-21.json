In 2018, the largest reported contributors were casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who contributed about $122 million in outside money to support such candidates, representing a 16-fold increase over the Perrys&#x2019; 2010 contributions, according to&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php?cycle=2018&amp;view=fc\">data</a>&#xA0;collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. What explains this dramatic shift in American elections, where the wealthiest Americans get to have even greater influence over who is elected and what policies elected officials pursue? The Supreme Court&#x2019;s 2010 opinion,&#xA0;<em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.</em></p><p>In 2010,<em>&#xA0;Citizens United</em>&#xA0;held that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend sums independently to support or oppose candidates for office. Looking at the amount of direct corporate spending in elections over the past decade, one might think that&#xA0;<em>Citizens United</em>&#xA0;was a bust.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680077\">Few for-profit corporations spend money</a>&#xA0;in their own names boosting or dissing&#xA0;candidates. But this case helped to usher in a sea change in American elections, and its influence on the decade that followed is hard to overstate. We&#x2019;ve seen an explosion of outside, often-undisclosed money in elections, candidates skirting campaign finance rules by having shadow &#x201C;super PACs,&#x201D; and dangerous foreign interference in our elections. And that pivotal opinion contains all the tools the Supreme Court needs to get rid of remaining campaign contribution limits.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_16 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109087\" data-a2a-title=\"&#x201C;The Decade of Citizens United&#x201D;\"><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook_like addtoany_special_service\" data-layout=\"button\" data-href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109087\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter_tweet addtoany_special_service\" data-url=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109087\" data-text=\"&#x201C;The Decade of Citizens United&#x201D;\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img src=\"/share_save_120_16.png\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div></div>\t\t\t"},{"title":"“Citizens United at 10: Why fighting corruption is a racial justice issue”","link":"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109085","pubDate":"2020-01-21T16:52:18.000Z","pubTime":"January 21, 2020 8:52 am","author":"Rick Hasen","content":"\n\t\t\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facingsouth.org/2020/01/citizens-united-10-why-fighting-corruption-racial-justice-issue\">Chris Kromm</a> for Facing South.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_16 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109085\" data-a2a-title=\"&#x201C;Citizens United at 10: Why fighting corruption is a racial justice issue&#x201D;\"><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook_like addtoany_special_service\" data-layout=\"button\" data-href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109085\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter_tweet addtoany_special_service\" data-url=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109085\" data-text=\"&#x201C;Citizens United at 10: Why fighting corruption is a racial justice issue&#x201D;\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img src=\"/share_save_120_16.png\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div></div>\t\t\t"},{"title":"“Celebrate the Citizens United Decade; The ruling has empowered small-dollar donors and political outsiders, not corporations.”","link":"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109083","pubDate":"2020-01-21T16:14:12.000Z","pubTime":"January 21, 2020 8:14 am","author":"Rick Hasen","content":"\n\t\t\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/celebrate-the-citizens-united-decade-11579553962?shareToken=stca29a9035c4b487bb9aaf32a49e0f1a9\">Brad Smith WSJ oped.</a> </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_16 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109083\" data-a2a-title=\"&#x201C;Celebrate the Citizens United Decade; The ruling has empowered small-dollar donors and political outsiders, not corporations.&#x201D;\"><a class=\"a2a_button_facebook_like addtoany_special_service\" data-layout=\"button\" data-href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109083\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter_tweet addtoany_special_service\" data-url=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109083\" data-text=\"&#x201C;Celebrate the Citizens United Decade; The ruling has empowered small-dollar donors and political outsiders, not corporations.&#x201D;\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img src=\"/share_save_120_16.png\" alt=\"Share\"></a></div></div>\t\t\t"},{"title":"Criticisms of New Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs) Hits New Los Angeles County Voting System","link":"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=109081","pubDate":"2020-01-21T16:11:17.000Z","pubTime":"January 21, 2020 8:11 am","author":"Rick Hasen","content":"\n\t\t\n<p>So far, most of the coverage of BMDs (voting machines in which voters cast their votes on a touchscreen, the machine spits out a ballot listing the voter&#x2019;s choices and produces a bar code/QR code for a ballot reading machine to tally the devices) have been of machines produced by for-profit companies in Georgia and North Carolina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Los Angeles County, the country&#x2019;s largest electoral jurisdiction, is about to roll out the use of BMD machines in the upcoming elections, machines which the county designed rather than buying through a vendor. (Disclosure: for a brief period when Justin Levitt was serving at DOJ, I took his place on an advisory committee about the new ballot machines, but because of scheduling conflicts I never attended a meeting or gave an input on the design).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it is time for the state of California to consider certification of the new LA BMDs, and some computer scientists/election integrity advocates are arguing that the machines are not secure enough to be certified.
