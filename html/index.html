<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A decade after the Supreme Court&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em>&nbsp;decision, super PACS and independent expenditures now dominate the political landscape.

Criticisms of New Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs) Hits New Los Angeles County Voting System</h3><div class="item-meta">By <b>RICK HASEN</b> at 8:11 am</div><div class="item-content">
		
<p>So far, most of the coverage of BMDs (voting machines in which voters cast their votes on a touchscreen, the machine spits out a ballot listing the voter&rsquo;s choices and produces a bar code/QR code for a ballot reading machine to tally the devices) have been of machines produced by for-profit companies in Georgia and North Carolina.</p>



<p>But Los Angeles County, the country&rsquo;s largest electoral jurisdiction, is about to roll out the use of BMD machines in the upcoming elections, machines which the county designed rather than buying through a vendor. (Disclosure: for a brief period when Justin Levitt was serving at DOJ, I took his place on an advisory committee about the new ballot machines, but because of scheduling conflicts I never attended a meeting or gave an input on the design).</p>



<p>Now it is time for the state of California to consider certification of the new LA BMDs, and some computer scientists/election integrity advocates are arguing that the machines are not secure enough to be certified. For example, see this letter from UC Berkeley Professor <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/vsap-sos-20.pdf">Philip Stark</a>. (More coverage at the <a href="https://bradblog.com/?p=13264">Brad Blog.</a>) </p>

<p><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/12/citizens-united-devastating-impact-american-politics.html">Reupping this Slate piece </a>of mine that ran in December, on what the opinion has meant in the last decade:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In 2010, the largest reported individual contributors to federal campaigns in American politics were Robert and Doylene Perry, owners of Perry Homes, who donated about $7.5 million to support Republican and conservative candidates. In 2018, the largest reported contributors were casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who contributed about $122 million in outside money to support such candidates, representing a 16-fold increase over the Perrys&rsquo; 2010 contributions, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php?cycle=2018&amp;view=fc">data</a>&nbsp;collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. What explains this dramatic shift in American elections, where the wealthiest Americans get to have even greater influence over who is elected and what policies elected officials pursue? The Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2010 opinion,&nbsp;<em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.</em></p><p>In 2010,<em>&nbsp;Citizens United</em>&nbsp;held that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend sums independently to support or oppose candidates for office. Looking at the amount of direct corporate spending in elections over the past decade, one might think that&nbsp;<em>Citizens United</em>&nbsp;was a bust.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680077">Few for-profit corporations spend money</a>&nbsp;in their own names boosting or dissing&nbsp;candidates. But this case helped to usher in a sea change in American elections, and its influence on the decade that followed is hard to overstate. We&rsquo;ve seen an explosion of outside, often-undisclosed money in elections, candidates skirting campaign finance rules by having shadow &ldquo;super PACs,&rdquo; and dangerous foreign interference in our elections. And that pivotal opinion contains all the tools the Supreme Court needs to get rid of remaining campaign contribution limits.</p></blockquote>
